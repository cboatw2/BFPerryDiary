in the twenty seventh year of my age. The last ten or eleven years  
of my life have been spent in close and hard study. Whether I have  
profited much by this close and uniting them upon it will be for  
time to show. Until two or three years I had learned nothing, or  
will be seen in the preface of my life. Perhaps, if I had continued  
in the same path, I should have been a happier and better man.  
I am certain are both possible. It is time I should have been  
become thoroughly wise from lessons. But certainly gain no pleasure.  
It is also very certain that I am not now what I am entirely ignorant.  
But in all probability I might have been more the time being  
much as the same. The all of my reading I have never taken  
notes, or made any comments on what I read, except occasionally  
to endorse or piece remarks for the people which I have been  
editing for them on these years past. This course to now intend  
to change. This my determination therefore to note down in this  
my book such works as I read, and comment on them. This  
resolution however may be departed from. At I advance in life  
my professional business, which is around and consequently I shall  
not have the same time to devote to amusement, letters, fun  
&c. I hope this may have the case for there is nothing that  
agree so well with my nature and feelings as active employment.  
work. It is particular for my happiness and contentment. To  
find work to be given me. To learn up in claim to study.  
these hard & it remarked by every sensible man that no  
one can study too much. I dare say often he is twenty five  
years old. There is a great deal of truth in the remark. I  
will here remark once for all before I close this simple  
preface that great allowance must be made for the style  
and composition of this Journal. It will always be written  
in great haste & without any regard to original. It  
make this remark in case my Journal or diary should  
containing the all possible intentions fall into the hands of  
anyone. It is my solemn determination that no one  
whatever not even my most intimate friend, shall see  
this Book. There are many good reasons for this  
determination and none which is quite sufficient is that it  
will contain a great heart, such as should not come to nor  
pass of even a friend. Here endeth the Preface.
