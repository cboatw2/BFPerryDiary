I commenced reading law in the Office of Judge Earle at
Greenville C.H. on the fourth day of March eighteen hundred and
twenty four, having ended my three Exhibits for the Western Circuit and
glad to the happy six profession. Mr. Thos. Warren R. Davis, Thomas
Harrison Esq., and Waddy Thompson Jr. were also practicing lawyers
at that time. Whilst reading law I acquired the reputation of a great
student. My studies were close and unremitting. They were not however
confined to the law. I read a great deal of history and biography. The latter
I was very fond of, passionately. I never cared much for poetry and did
not read likely, tho' many novels. I continued to read law in
the Office of Judge Earle until the Fall of twenty six when I went
to Columbia and continued my studies in the Office of Col. Gregg.
I was admitted to practice in the Courts of Common Law
Equity in January fifteen hundred and twenty seven. Whilst I was
under the direction of Judge Earle I underwent no examination
whatever. But in Columbia I was examined very frequently by
Col. Gregg with four or five young men who were reading
law in his office at the same time. Examinations are very
important to law students, but very troublesome to the gentleman
under whom they are reading. I will here remark a great
error which characterized the whole of my reading. I read law
too rapidly and consequently did not understand them. Such
reading may be compared to the pouring of water into a sieve.
The runs out as fast as it is poured in. But as the impression
made on the mind is affected as speedily as it is made, let the
student, who is in the progress of his reading, go on slowly
and mark attentively every thing that he reads. Never should he read
too much in the day. Let him study not more than eight
or ten hours in twenty four. I did not however observe this
rule myself. I used to rise pretty early in the morning and then
study until ten o'clock and then from two o'clock in the evening
until ten or eleven at night. Although I pursued this
course for several years I never experienced any inconvenience
from it. My health was apparently very good. But I was blessed
with a wonderful constitution.

After my admission to the Bar I did
relax the least in my studies. I continued to read over and over
again all the elementary law books which I could procure.
