Sketch of My Life

I was born in Pendleton District South Carolina on the twentieth
day of November in the year one thousand and seven hundred and five.
My Father Benjamin Perry was born in the township of Sherburne
Massachusetts on the fifteenth of September seventeen hundred and sixty
one. His Grand Father left England about the close of the seventeenth
century and settled in Massachusetts. He raised a large family of children
who all lived and died in Massachusetts. My Father was the youngest
son of Nathan Perry by his first wife. He had thirteen or fifteen
brothers and sisters. At the age of sixteen my Father had lost
his mother and resolved to visit the country of his ancestry. He
was in the attack on Rhode Island made by the united forces
of General Sullivan and the French Fleet under Count d'Estaing.
At the age of twenty three he went to Boston and united him
self as a clerk in a store. In the year seventeen hundred and
eighty five he came to Charleston where he married in the
store of Wadsworth and Turpin and in two years, he and his
brother Nathaniel Perry then came to Pendleton District and
bought a store for
some time. They both afterwards moved into Pendleton Dist
where my Father has lived ever since. He was married in ninety

the mothers side was an officer in the American Revolution
and had command of a company at the siege of Savannah. He

with myself are all the children my father had. There are
but nine names on Nathaniel R. Perry, Harriet O. H. and

enough to live well and comfortably. He has always borne
the character of an honest and an industrious man among
his neighbors and acquaintances. He is the most indus
trious man I ever knew. My mother is a woman of remark
able and natural endowments. She is the kindest and most
affectionate mother in the world. But her kindness does not
stop with her children but extends to every one of her acquain
tance. I am under great personal obligations to both of them for
their unceasing kindness to me through life. I have had Parents
