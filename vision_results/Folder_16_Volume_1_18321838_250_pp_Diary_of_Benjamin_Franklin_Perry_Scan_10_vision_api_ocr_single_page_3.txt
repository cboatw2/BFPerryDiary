in the twenty seventh year of my age. The last ten or eleven years  
of my life have been spent in close and hard study. Whether I have  
profited much by this close and uniting them spent it will be for  
time to show. Until two or three years I had learned nothing, as  
will be seen in the sketch of my life. Perhaps, if I had continued  
in the same path, I should have been a happier and better man.  
I am certain on both points. It is true I should never have been  
known twenty miles from Hanover. But notoriety gives no pleasure.  
It is also very certain that I should not have been so ignorant.  
But in all probability I might have been as well known, though  
much as the same. The all of my reading I have never taken  
notes, or made any comments on what I read, except occasionally  
to endorse a few remarks for the people which I have been  
editing for three or four years past. This course is now about  
to change. It is my determination hereafter to note down in this  
my book, such works as I read, and comment on them. This  
resolution however may be departed from. At no man in life  
has profited much, who is aware and conversely I shall  
not. At the same time, to doubt the correctness of this pro-  
ceeds, I hope this may have the case for there is nothing that  
gives me more with my nature and feelings, as active employ-  
ment. It is particular for my happiness and contentment. To  
find work to be given me. To learn up in claim to study.  
These hard & it remarked by every sensible man that no  
one can study too much. I dare say often he is twenty five  
years old. There is a great deal of truth in the remark. I  
will here remark once for all, before I close this single  
preface that great allowance must be made for the style  
and composition of this Journal. It will always be written  
in great haste and without any regard to original. It  
makes this remark in case my Journal or Diary should  
conting to all present intentions fall into the hands of  
any one. It is my solemn determination that no one  
whatever not even my most intimate friend, shall see  
this Book. There are many good reasons for this  
determination and among which a single sufficient is that it  
will contain a great heart, such as should not come to nor  
does it ever a friend. Here ends the Preface.
