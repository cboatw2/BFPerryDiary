Preface

This book is not intended for the inspection of any one. My object in
commencing it is to afford occupation for leisure time, and to treasure up
events, which may be useful in after life. There are many circumstances
daily transpiring which if remembered would be important. Indeed the
words, the conversation and opinions of distinguished men which it
may be my good fortune to hear in this campaign. It is my intention
to give my own views on the occurrences of the times. By this means
I shall be enabled to compare my feelings and sentiments in early life with
those which I may possess in old age. Every man ought to keep a
journal of his life. It would be a source of great satisfaction to
refer to it when the scenes of which it is a record are distant
from his memory. I regret very much that I did not commence
this work sooner. If I had done so, I should have had the satisfaction
of being able to produce an accurate account of incidents which might have
of great service to me. I will first give a sketch of my life up to
the present time with an account of my parentage and infancy. This
may seem puerile and mainly egotistical. But no matter, even if it is.
No one will ever see it. But after my death the number of great things
before will inevitably fall into the hands of some person. What of
that? If it should fall into the hands of some one who cares anything
about me, it will be interesting to him to know everything
which concerns me: and if it perchance to fall into the hands
of an individual who cares nothing about me or my memory,
he will of course never think it worth while to read the book.
This work will likewise contain sketches of my daily impressions
and with whom I may chance to meet. It will also be
an account of my progress and unfulfilled man's estate. It will
which it is my good intention to fill in with incidents
deem everything of importance. The work will be shall be
a record of my life, my actions, my opinions and the feelings
of my heart. Which will be at my day of my love secrets. And the
what book of things? No I never expect to be tempted in that
way again. My family will ever be a barrier to any
designs on that score. I must know poor and know my persuasions
that I shall remain so. There are some things already put
which I remember. There shall be written down I am now
