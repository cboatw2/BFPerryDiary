he  
been more indulgent to a child than they have to me. Ever  
since I have been in need when it was in their power to  
give me. My brothers are both very sensible strong minded young  
men and if they had been devoted and have succeeded in virtue of their  
professions. My sister seems the same in her [illegible] of her mother kindness  
and affection. Between us there has ever been the most devoted attachment  
I am sure that no man can ever mourn death of a brother than  
she to me.  

There is another in my childhood worth mentioning. I grew  
up as most children do and as in the course of time always fond  
of going to school and learnt my fate. At the age of sixteen through the  
voice and influence of my uncle Robert Hester whose unpretended  
kindness to me I never can forget. I was placed at a grammar  
school under the tuition of Mr. Porter at Ashville North Carolina.  
There I commenced the language with a much youthful ambition  
and filled the bosom of a school boy. There did I dig over study  
more closely than I did at Ashville. We passed a year in the  
Latin and Greek language with peculiar [illegible]. We expect another  
year in the time I commenced the Latin I commenced the French and  
and [illegible] Historie course. This Roman Caesar Virgil Horace  
Cicero, Greek Grammar, Latin or the Acts of the Apostles, Greek  
Grammar & Greek Major. I studied about sixteen hours in my  
day. At the expiration of eight months I returned this way to Athens  
and there spent the winter in renewing the classics. In the  
spring of eighteen hundred and twenty three I came on giving  
the school to Granville Church, where I studied Mathematics and  
natural Philosophy under the direction of Mr. Hodge. I also read  
with the gentleman Thomas Alston. I did all this in one quarter  
and again returned to Athens where I spent the fall and  
winter in reading History. There I should have for my uncle R  
Hester I should have been too attached to abandon my studies on  
entering my Mother. She was not able to advance my studies on  
possessing a good deal of property. Uncle Hester kindly stepped forward  
and agreed to supply me with funds. Which he has done with a  
cheerfully when I could under all the circumstances. He insisted  
on my going at college and agreed to furnish the means. I  
it was impossible him to look at therefore declined. I have regretted  
it ever since.
