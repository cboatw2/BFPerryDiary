in the twenty seventh year of my age. The last ten or eleven years of my life have been spent in close and hard study. Whether I have profited much by this close and uniting study, it will be for time to show. Until it was too late for me to learn anything, it will be seen in the spectacle of my life. Perhaps, if I had continued in the same path, I should have been a happier and better man. I am certain on both points, it is time I should never have been known through any public manner. But publicity gives no pleasure. It is also very certain that I am not now what I am entirely ignorant. But in all probability I might have been at this time twice as much as I am. The all of my reading I have never taken notes, or made any comments on what I read, except occasionally to endorse a few remarks for the people which I have been editing for them on these years past. This course is now about to change. This, my determination, therefore, is not to dismiss this in hopes of such works as I read, and comment on them. This resolution however may be departed from. At no man in life has profited himself, if he is aware and consequently I shall not. At the same time, I doubt the communications from which I hope this may have the case for there is nothing that gives me more with my nature and feelings, as active employment. It is particular for my happiness, and certain must be this work to be given due. I learned up in claims to study, those hard & it remarked by every sensible man that no one can study too much. I dare say often he is twenty five years old. There is a great deal of truth in this remark. I will here remark once for all before I close this single paper that great allowance must be made for the style and composition of this journal. It will always be written in great haste and without any regard to original. It makes this remark in case my journal or diary should contain the all of present intentions fall into the hands of anyone. It is my solemn determination that no one whatever not even my most intimate friend, shall see this Book. There are many good reasons for this determination and among which is quite sufficient is that it will contain a great heart, such as should not come to the ears of even a friend. Here ends the Preface.
